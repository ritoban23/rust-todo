- check if 'cargo' command is running in terminal
- 'cargo init' to initialize files
- 'cargo run' to run check if main.rs is working
- 'cargo run' was showing some error on powershell so switched to wsl , error on wsl so did 'sudo apt update'
'sudo apt install build-essential' to fix it, 'cargo run' gave output
- 'cargo add axum' and 'cargo add tokio'
- added /target anf **/*.rs.bk to .gitignore ....(/target is for compiled build files, **/*.rs.bk is for backup Rust files, if any
